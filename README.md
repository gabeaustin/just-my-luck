# Just My Luck

This is an interactive slot machine. The user has to click the Spin button in hopes of getting three 4's. If the user get three 4's in a row, a winner message is displayed.

For all three numbers, the state is initialized to 0. There is a random number generator that selects numbers 1 - 4. Each time the click event happens, the state for all three numbers is changed. Once the user gets all three 4's, the game is over and the button is removed.

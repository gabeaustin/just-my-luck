# Just My Luck

This is an interactive slot machine. The user has to click the lever (pull the lever) in hopes of getting all 7's. This won't be easy. If the user get three 7's in a row, a winner message is display.

For all three numbers, the state was initialized to null. There was a random number generator created to randomly select numbers 1 - 7. Each time the click event happened, the state for all 3 numbers is changed. Once the user gets all three 7's, the game is over and the button (lever) is removed.

# Just My Luck

This is an interactive slot machine. The user has to click the Spin button in hopes of getting three 2's. If the user gets three 2's, a winner message is displayed.

For all three numbers, the state is initialized to 0. There is a random number generator that selects numbers 1 - 2. Each time the click event happens, the state for all three numbers is changed. Once the user gets all three 2's, the game is over and the Spin button changes to a Play Again button. Also, once the user wins, the background colors change to random colors.
